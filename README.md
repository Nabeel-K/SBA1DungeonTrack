# SBA1 - DungeonTrack
Project for SBA1

This small site serves as a utility tool for Dungeons&Dragons players. It allow players to keep track of a small amount of inventory and roll dice in place of buying a physical set of dice. The site consists of the following pages:

Landing Page -  home page that serves as a menu for the rest of the site
Dice roller - This page lets the user rolls from a choice of standard set of RPG dice
Inventory - Keeps track of common items, such as potions and arrows, that players may obtain as they play.
Contact us - basic form for collecting user questions or comments

Pages are kept in a html folder with images, scripts, and css in subfolders.
